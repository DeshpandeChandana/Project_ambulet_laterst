      
      SeaMo: A VHO implementation for seamless mobility across HWNs
      -------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
1. Fedora 12-14, and Ubuntu-11.04 Linux distributions
2. USB dongle to access 3G network (Tested with HUAWEI, 
   HSPA USB Stick, Model:E1750)


IMPORTANT_NOTE:
--------------
Plug in your 3G dongle. If NetworkManger could not detect your 3G device 
(dongle) then DO NOT proceed further. SeaMo heavily depends on NetworkManager 
daemon and its lingo. 

To configure your 3G device read HOWTO_CONFIGURE_3G_DEVICE in config folder.


INSTALLATION STEPS
------------------

Step 1: Build the SeaMo source code

        > sh build.sh

Step 2: Run the script install.sh as root

        # sh install.sh
	The install script installs the SeaMo binaries and configuration files
        in /usr/local/seamo 

Step 3: Edit the configuration file in /usr/local/seamo/conf/seamo.conf

Step 4: Connect to any available network through NetworkManager 

Step 5: Start the seamo daemon as root

        # service seamod start

Congratulations!!!
You have successfully started SeaMo. 

SeaMo LOGS
----------
- You can see the logs and other information in /var/log/messages.
- You can increase the debug level by enabling them in 
  corresponding header files to see more debug information.
 
ADVANCED CONFIGURATION for seamless mobility using HIP/MIPv6 
------------------------------------------------------------

SeaMo hands over automatically to the best network available but does
not ensure application level session continuity during the hand overs.

For seamless mobility, in addition to SeaMo, one needs the support of mobility
protocols such as HIP/MIPv6

Read Step 6 below for setting up HIP.

Step 6: In order to maintain the session and experience seamless handovers
        install any mobility protocol that supports vertical handovers.
        We have tested with Host Identity Protocol (HIP), InfraHIP.

Now you are set to move across 3G and WLAN networks and use SeaMo to experience
seamless mobility
