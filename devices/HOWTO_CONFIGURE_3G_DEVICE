CONFIGURING 3G device
---------------------

If NetworkManager does not detect your 3G device then try
any of the following steps.

1. Execute run-me.sh in devices folder. 
   If this does not help the NetworkManager 
   detect 3G device then try the second option.

2. Copy the file 20-custom-huawei.rules which is in
   devices folder into /etc/udev/rules.d

   If both of the options did not help you, then we are
   sorry we cannot help you in detecting your 3G device.
   Try it yourself.

If your using the 3G device for the first time then configure
your 3G device as follows:

1. Right click on NetworkManager > Edit Connections > Mobile Broadband > Add
2. Follow the steps on the new window.
3. Make sure that the connection name has no spaces
